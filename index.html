        <h3>Build climber and bus stoper </h3>
        <p>I have moved to this city three months ago. I love the street food here. On weekends, I explore new eating joints. This way, I get to learn the routes of this city and prepare myself professionally. Being a sales professional, my profile requires a lot of traveling.I have been born and brought up in Jaipur. I came to Delhi 3 months ago to explore professional opportunities. I have already rented a place in West Delhi and enjoying the Delhi winters .I have done my schooling from Jaipur. For my graduation, I chose Xyz program at Abc University. It was a very enriching experience at the University as not only we were actively involved in practical projects, but also got opportunities to participate in a number of sports and other extra-curricular activities such as plays and skits.</p>
